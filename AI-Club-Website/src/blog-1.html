                    <p>As 2017 wraps up, I want to look forward to some opportunities for the future in voice tech and
                        conversational AI. These are technologies that developers of voice agents and skills don‚Äôt have
                        that still remain to be built. Believe it or not, your home‚Äôs smart speaker isn‚Äôt the smartest,
                        most capable member of your family. Yet. üòÅ</p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, what the voice agents that you interact with can do is determined by the
                        capabilities that developers in this field have access to. So in this post, I‚Äôm going to take
                        the perspective of a developer working on building conversational intelligent agents. I want to
                        hypothesize about what technologies remain to be developed or at least widely applied. Most of
                        the excitement in this area has come out of the rapid adoption of smart speakers, so I‚Äôm going
                        to focus a fair bit on the specifics of vocal computing technology specifically.
                    </p>
                    <p>My goal is just to identify a few of the pieces between where we are today and the day when
                        everyone has a J.A.R.V.I.S.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="mt-5" style="font-weight: bold;">Conversational Tooling</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The opportunities in this section are applicable to conversational interfaces, whether those
                        interfaces are voice or text.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Portable Conversational Skills</h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        One of the best parts of being a developer now as opposed to, say, 20 years ago is that we all
                        share our toys so much better than we used to. Between powerful cloud APIs and the world of open
                        source on GitHub, the average developer today has access to huge amounts of powerful technology
                        that can be composed very rapidly. In the world of conversational agents, it‚Äôs amazing how
                        quickly developers can hack up a quick chatbot that can hold a simple conversation, send text
                        messages, order you a car, and so on.</p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to the excitement around voice-based agents introduced by smart speakers, a lot more
                        developers are working on building conversational interfaces than ever before. However, there
                        aren‚Äôt a lot of good examples of building blocks that can be used to build up the basics needed
                        to create a conversational agent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best example of what I‚Äôd like to have is DialogFlow‚Äôs concept of Prebuilt Agents. They are
                        reusable conversational skills, but they‚Äôre constrained for use within DialogFlow specifically.
                    </p>
                    <img src="..//assets/Blog-1/pre-built-agents.png" class="supporting-images" alt="">
                    <p> 
                        What I‚Äôd really like is a generic module that can be used to talk about the weather across a wide range of runtimes. Since I don‚Äôt have time to build such a thing, I‚Äôm probably going to suggest this idea to my friends at Jovo. Having conversational skills as something like Node modules that could just be plugged into an open source, cross platform framework like Jovo would go a long way towards making developing for voice more like UI development for other platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>Speaking of missing tools for voice agent development, there‚Äôs another big class of functionality that I find missing for voice.
                    </p>
